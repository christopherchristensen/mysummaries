# Security Requirements

## Security
* Defense of computers against
    * instrusion
    * unauthorized use of resources
    * humans with malicious or criminal intent

## Safety
* Avoiding hazardous situations
* Alerting the correct systems if situation becomes unsafe
* Defending humans / environment against malfunctioning systems

## Important Notes about Security
- Security
    - is not a programming problem only
    - must be considered from the beginning on
    - is relevant in all phases of software development
    - can't be fixed by using special methods / tools
    - can't be seen isolated from deployment / operations

## Security vs. Safety
* No strict borderline between both concepts
* Security breaches may have serious safety consequences

## Perimeter Security
* Measures to protect external perimeter of a system
    * Access Control
    * Firewalls
    * Anti Virus Software
* Not sufficient by today's standards (medieval concept of yesterday)

## Why is Perimeter Security not sufficient anymore?
* More applications offer direct access to external users
* Modern applications often considered to be doors into OS ($\sim$ wall)

## Why Perimeter Security often focused on before Insecurities in Software?
> Bad Practice

* Secure coding often not considered to be important in the past
* Often, security professionals $\neq$ software developers (full insight into software vulnerabilities missing)
* Functionality often focus of software developers
* Vendors want quick time to market, often no time for proper security architecture, design and testing
* Customers used to flaws and regular security updates (patches)
* Customers can't control software flaws, therefore depend upon perimeter protection

## How to Intrusion happens
1. Infection
2. Exploit
3. Payload

## Malware
> **Mal**icious Soft**ware**

* Software doing something the user / owner of the computer doesn't like
* Special forms of malware
    * Virus
    * Worm
    * Trojan

## Infection
* How malware gets into system
* When user trusts a piece of software (with malware)

## Exploit
> "to use something to one's own advantage"

* Taking advantage of weak points in systems / applications
* Piece of software, chunk of data, or a sequence of commands 
    * that takes advantage of a bug / vulnerability 
    * to cause unintended / unanticipated behavior on computer software, hardware, or something electronic

## Vulnerabilities
* Programming errors (direct or indirect)
* Vulnerabilities lead to exploits
* Attacker must have applicable tool / technique that can connect to a system weakness (attack surface)

## Example of an Indirect Error
* Flawed handling of memory management
    * may render a system vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks
    * doesn't effect system's functionality therefore may remain undetected during testing

## Can Vulnerabilities and Exploits be prevented?
* Every system of minimum complexity contains errors
* No way of completely preventing it
* Relative security can be reached by
    * clean and intelligent software development
    * including security considerations in all phases of a system

## Ways to improve Security
* Security and functionality need to be designed and integrated into the individual phases of a development life cycle
* Security considerations need to be interlaced into product core
* Understand security needs, implement the right controls and test thoroughly

## Security Cost Considerations
* The higher the security efforts, the lower the costs for security breaches
* The higher the security efforts, the higher the costs for security measures
* With the right amount of security efforts the total costs can be kept at a minimum

## Attributes of Software Security
* Quality
* Correctness
* Availability
* Robustness
* Verifiability
* Reliability
* Safety

## What does Software Engineering deal with?
* Cost-effective development of high-quality software

## Scales of Software Project
* Trivial
    * Staff: 1, 4-6 Weeks, Lines of code < 500
    * e.g. Simple administrative programs
* Small
    * Staff: 1, 1-6 Months, Lines of code: 1'000-2'000
    * e.g. Small commercial applications

* 10% Other

## How much do Bugs cost in Relation to their Source?
* 82% Analysis and Specification
* 13% Design
* 1% Coding

## Process Models
> Description of a process

* Activities must be 
    * defined exactly
    * arranged along a time scale
* Process model is the starting point for
    * project planning
    * project management

## DREAD
> Methodology for risk rating

* Damage
* Reproducibility
* Exploitability
* Affected Users
* Discoverability

## DREAD: Damage (Potential)
* How bad would an attack be?
* Rating High (3):
    * Attacker can undermine security system
    * Get full trust authorization
    * Run as admin
    * Upload content
* Rating Medium (2):
    * Lead sensitive information
* Rating Low (1):
    * Lead trivial information

## DREAD: Reproducibility
* How easy to reproduce attack?
* Rating High (3):
    * Attack reproducable every time
    * Attack doesn't require timing window
* Rating Medium (2):
    * Attack reproducable
    * Only within a timing window and partical race situation
* Rating Low (1):
    * Attack difficult to reproduce
    * Even with knowledge of security hole

## DREAD: Exploitability
* How much work to launch attack?
* Rating High (3):
    * Novice programmer could make attack in short time
* Rating Medium (2):    
    * Skilled programmer could make attack, then repeat steps
* Rating Low (1):    
    * Attack requires extremely skilled person
    * Requires in-depth knowledge every time

## DREAD: Affected Users
* How many people will be impacted?
* Rating High (3):
    * All users
    * Default configuration
    * Key customers
* Rating Medium (2):
    * Some users
    * Non-default configuration
* Rating Low (1):
    * Very small percentage of users
    * Obscure feature
    * Affects anonymous users

## DREAD: Discoverability
* How easy is it to discover threat?
* Rating High (3):
    * Published info explains attack
    * Vulnerability found in most commonly used feature
    * Very noticeable
* Rating Medium (2):
    * Vulnerability in seldom-used part of product
    * Only some user should come across it
    * Requires some thinking to see malicious use
* Rating Low (1):
    * Bug is obscure
    * Unlikely that users will find damage potential

## Why don't all organizations include Discoverability in DREAD?
> DREAD-D, "DREAD minus D"

* They feel Discoverability rewards "Security through Obscurity"
* They then ignore it or always assume Discoverability at maximum rating (3)

## DREAD Rating Calculation
* After rating each Bug or Threat
* Put all into rows of table and sum up DREAD ratings 

## Possible Exam Question to DREAD
* Threat given
* Attacker Profile given (Skill, Motivation, ...)
* Rate the Threat

## OWASP Risk Rating
> Part of Threat Modelling

* Threat Agent
* Vulnerability
* Technical Impact
* Business Impact

## Attack Tree
> Part of Threat Modelling

* Conceptual diagrams showing how an asset, or target, might be attacked
* Nodes combined by AND / OR
    * OR: Represents different ways to achieve same goal
    * AND: Represents different steps in achieving goal
* Costs assigned to activities

## Attack Tree - Node Values
* Values can be assigned to leaf nodes
    * Boolean
    * Cost to attack
    * Cost to defend
    * Time to achieve
    * Time to repulse
    * Probability of success of attack
    * Likelihood that attacker will try attack

## Attack Tree - Node Value Calculation
* AND-Nodes: Values of subnodes must be added
* OR-Nodes: Take one (the minimum) value of subnodes

## Attack Tree - Countermeasures
* Add further nodes with countermeasures

## UML
> Unified Modeling Language

* Modeling requirements during system analysis
* Standard language for...
    - specifying,
    - visualising,
    - constructing,
    - documenting
* ...software systems

## 9 UML Diagrams
* (Use case diagram)
* Class diagram
* Object diagram
* State diagram
* Activity diagram
* Sequence diagram
* Collaboration diagram
* Component diagram
* Deployment diagram
* Timing diagram

## Use Case Diagram
> UCD

* To identify primary elements (actors) and processes (use cases) of system
* Shows which actors interact with each use case
* Actions described from actor's view

## 4 Elements of UCD
* Actors (elements that interact with system)
* System
* Use Cases (services that system performs)
* Lines (relationships)

## Use Case
- Distinct business functionality or behaviour of system
- Sequence of related activities done by actor together with system
- Represents some action the user might perform to complete a task

## Actor
- External interface of system
- Any entity that performs certain roles in system
- Activates flow of actions in system and influences them

## User Cases vs. User-Stories
- User-Stories 
    - common in Agile Dev. / Scrum
    - used for planning Use Cases
    - cut into pieces until they are implemented in one iteration
- Use Cases
    - bigger, more context information
    - define and document functionality

## Analysis with Use Cases
- Draw a context model
- Write a glossary
- Detail the context model
- Define scenarios with sequence diagrams
- Use activity diagrams to generalize

## Context Model
- Draw one Use Case for whole system
- Includes all actors that interact with system
- For each actor all functions shown

## Analysis with Use Cases including Security
- (Steps above)
- Add Misuse Cases

## Misuse Cases
- Based on Use-Case terminology
- Defined and completed by Mitigation Cases
- Process
    - Insert Misuse Cases
    - Describe Misuse Cases
    - Find Mitigation Use Case

## Misuse Case Description Elements
- Misuse Case Name
- Misuser Profile
- Description
- Basic Path
- Alternative Paths
- Triggers
- Assumptions
- Mitigation

## Why are Systems Vulnerable?
> Interfaces as Special Problems

- Systems consist of components
    - developed independently
    - have input data
    - exchange data
- Components need interfaces
    - rules for input data define a language
    - language must be defined exactly
    - language must be interpreted exactly in same way on both sides of interface

[missing content here ... (interface types)] 

## Goals when securing Interfaces
- Secure Input Validation
    - Accept only valid input
    - Always interpret input the same way
    - No unforeseen reactions on any input
- Identical interpretation on both sides of interface
    - Language of sender must equal language of receiver
    - Design contracts must be defined explicitly
    - Design contracts must be followed in provable way

## Communication Model by Shannon
> 1948

- Sender: sends Message M that is Encoded(M) and send over a Channel
- Receiver: receives Encoded(M), then message is Decoded(Encoded(M))

## Problem with Communication Model by Shannon
- The decoded message can be wrong
- Receiver can react differently as expected by sender,
- Because implementation of Decoded(...) may be wrong

## How can Attacker exploit the above Problem?
- Find a combination of M, Encoded(...), Decoded(...) with these properties:
    - M $\neq$ Decoded(Encoded(M))
    - M is semantically valid for sender
    - Decoded(Encoded(M)) is semantically valid for receiver
    - Processing of M at receiver is not equal to processing of Decoded(Encoded(M)) at receiver

## Typical Exploit-Techniques used by Malware
- SQL Injection
- Command Injection
- XSS
- Buffer Overflows
- String Overflows

## Means to mitigate Exploits
- Check all Input Data
    - Which data, where, when
- Problems
    - Amount
    - Efficiency
    - Bypassing
    - Streaming
