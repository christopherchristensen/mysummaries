## Introduction

* Internet is super duper important



## Network Sizes

* Small Home Networks
  + e.g. Sharing printers, documents, ...
* Small Office / Home Office Networks
  * e.g. Connect to your office from home
* Medium to Large Networks (Enterprise)
  * e.g. Consolidation, storage, access to information
  * e.g. Email, instant messaging, collaboration amongst employees
* World Wide Networks (WWW)
  * e.g. Internet



## Hosts

* Computers connected to a network that participate directly in network communication
* End devices



## Servers

* Computers with software that
  * Enable them to provide information to other end devices
  * e.g. Email, web pages
* Each service requires separate server software
* Can provide services to one or many clients
* A single computer can run multiple types of server software



## Clients

* Computers with software (e.g. web browser) installed that
  * Enable them to request and display information obtained from server
* A single computer can run multiple types of client software



## Types of Clients and Servers

* File Client and Server
* Web Client and Server
* Email Client and Server



## Peer-to-Peer

> P2P

* Client and server software usually runs on separate computers
* Also possible for one computer to carry out both roles 



## Advantages of P2P

* Easy setup
* Less complexity
* Lower cost 
  (no dedicated servers, etc.)
* For simple tasks 
  (file transfer, sharing printers, etc.)



## Disadvantages of P2P

* No centralized administration
* Not as secure
* Not scalable
* Slower performance 
  (all devices could be client and server)



## 3 Components of Network Infrastructure

* Devices
* Media
* Services



## Processes

* Provide funktionaliy
* Direct and move messages through the network
* Less obvious to us but critical to the operation of networks



## End Devices

* Source or destination of a message transmitted over network
* Distinguished by an address
* Use addresses to define where messages should be sent
* PC, Smartphone, etc.



## Intermediary Network Devices

> IND: Intermediary Network Devices

* Connect end devices to network
* Connect multiple networks to form an internetwork
* Provide connectivity
* Ensure data flows across the network



## Examples of INDs

* (Wireless) Router

* LAN / Multilayer Switch

* Firewall Appliance

  



## How do INDs work?

* Use destination end devices address and information about network interconnections to determine path of message through network



## Function of INDs

* Regenerate and retransmit data signals
* Maintain info about existing pathways through (inter)network
* Notify other devices of errors and communication failures
* Direct data along alternate pathways if link failure
* Classify and direct messages according to priorities
* Permit or deny flow of data, based on security settings



## Network Media

* Carries out communication accross a network
* Provides channel over which a message travels from source to destination



## 3 Basic Forms of Network Media

- Electrical Signals (Copper cable)
- Light Pulse (Fiber-optic cable)
- Microwave Signals (Wireless)



## Network Representations

* Use Topology Diagram
* Important terms
  * Network Interface Card (NIC / LAN Adapter)
  * Physical Port
  * Interface



## Topology Diagrams

* Provide visual map of how network is connected
* Physical topology diagrams
  * Identify physical location of INDs
* Logical topology diagrams
  * Identify devices, ports and addressing scheme



## Types of Networks

* Local Area Network (LAN)
* Wide Area Network (WAN)
* Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
* Wireless LAN (WLAN)
* Storage Area Network (SAN)



## LAN

> Local Area Network

* Provides acces to users and end devices
* Small geographical area
* Provides high speed bandwidth to
  * Internal end devices
  * Intermediary devices
* Typically by enterprise, home, small business network, campus, ...
* Usually administered by single organization or individual
* Administrative control enforced on network level 
* Administrative control governs security and access control policies



## WAN

> Wide Area Network

* Provides access to other networks
* Wide geographical area (cities, states, provinces, countries, continents, …)
* Typically managed by (multiple)
  * Service Providers (SP)
  * Internet Service Providers (ISP)
* Provide slower speed links between LANs (typically)



## MAN

> Metropolitan Area Network

* Larger area than LAN but smaller than WAN
* City, ...
* Typically by single entity (large organization)



## SAN

> Storage Area Network

* Designed to support file servers
* Provide data storage, retrieval and replication



## Internet

* Worldwide collection of interconnected networks
* Not owned by any individual or group
* Relies on
  * Consistent and commonly recognized technologies and standards
  * Cooperation of many network administration agencies



## Internet Organizations and Agencies

* Help maintain structure and standardization of Internet protocols and processes
* Some examples,
  * Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
  * Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)
  * Internet Architecture Board (IAB)
  * ...



## Internet, Extranets and Intranets

> Biggest to smallest

* Internet
  * The world
* Extranet
  * Suppliers, customers, collaborators, ...
  * Provide secure safe access to individuals between different organizations
  * e.g. Company providing acces to suppliers contractors
  * e.g. Hospital providing a booking system to doctors for making appointments for patients
  * e.g. Local office of education providing budget to schools in its district
* Intranet
  * Private connection of LANs and WANs
  * Belong to organizations
  * Access only by members, employees, ...



## Internet Access Technologies

* Home Users
* Teleworkers (Remote Workers)
* Internet Service Provider (ISP)
  * Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)
  * Wireless WANs
  * Mobile Services



## Home and Small Office Internet Connections

* Cable
* DSL
* ADSL
* Cellular
* Satellite
* Dial-up Telephone
* Often connect directly with fiber optic cables
  * Higher bandwidth speeds
  * Supports more services (Internet, phone, TV, …)
* Choice of connection depends on 
  * Geography
  * Available ISP



## Business Internet Connections

* Dedicated Leased Line
  * Reserved circuits within ISP netwrok
  * Connects geographically separated offices
  * Montly or yearly rental rate (can be expensive)
* Ethernet WAN
  * Extends LAN into WAN
  * Benefits of Ethernet extended into WAN
* Business DSL (SDSL)
* Satellite
* Choice of connection depends on 
  * Geography
  * Available ISP
