# Secure Programming



## What is Secure Programming?

* art of making sure 
  * that software we develop 
  * does what it is expected to do
  * and that is all it does
* namely it can't be misused in ways foreseen at development



## Why Secure Programming?

* Software is in our lives more and more (sensitive information, etc.)

  

## How do we develop in a secure way?

* Security requirements
* Secure designs, policies, governance
* But someone has to implement this all



## Why are creating designs, policies, governance difficult?

* Someone has to implement the designs, policies, governance
  * If we are lucky they work from the beginning
  * Even then, all design and policy guarantees can easily be broken by implementation flaws



## What are often the weakest link?

* Implementation details



TODO Example Summary Apple goto fail ff.



## Neccessities to master Secure Programming

* Grasp nature of software vulnerabilities
  (common design and implementatino mistakes, etc.)
* Understand common vulnerability classes
* Appreciate mitigation principles and techniques
* Understand the software development process and modern SDLC practices
* Being able to devise a **Threat Model**



## Vulnerabilities and IT Risk

* $$\text{Risk} = \text{Impact} \cdot \text{Probability}$$
* $$\text{IT Risk} = \text{Impact} \cdot \text{Threat Level} \cdot \text{Vulnerability Level}$$
* Threat Level: Capabilities of malicious agent (skills and resources)
* Vulnerability Level: Presence of flaw and ease of exploitability



> If a vulnerability in our system is easy to exploit an attacker does not have to be especially skilled or have plentiful resources (money) to do us big harm.



## Microsoft Vulnerability Mitigation Strategy

> Strategy: Make it difficult and costly to find, exploit and leverage vulnerabilities

1. Eliminate
   * Software vulnerability
2. Break exploitation techniques
   * Class specific exploitation primitive
   * Generic exploitation primitive
3. Contain
   * Payload

(TODO maybe add rest of table)



## Security in Software Development Process

* Requirements
  * what do protect
  * threat model
* Specification and design
  * how to make it happen
  * how to make it usable
* Testing
  * e.g. penetration testing
* Maintenance
  * regular review, means for quick response, ...



## From Design to Implementation

* Details appear that were ignored at design time, so
* Concretize input / output 
  * Fields, formats, encodings, protocols
* Adopt assumptions on context
  * Libraries, APIs, consumed services
  * Compute environment, resources
  * Concurrency model
* Attack surface grows
* Vulnerabilities arise
* Threat model refines



## Attack surfaces

* Sum of the different points (the "attack vectors") 
* where an unauthorized user (the "attacker") can try to
  * enter data to an environment
  * extract data from an environment
* Through an attack surface, conceptionally, an adversary can
  * Modify data or behavior of a system, and/or
  * Observe it
    

## What Attack Surfaces exist?

* User interfaces
* Network connections
* System interfaces / IPC interfaces
* Database
* Storage
* Log

> Which are Modification and which are Observation Surface?



## From Design to Implementation (Cont.)

* aspects were omitted from the design on purpose
  * to manage complexity systems are composed of high level components
  * otherwise we would be writing web apps in assembly
* This leads to a problem, because
  * well, these abstractions are only present at a conceptual level
  * and attackers do not respect abstraction boundaries either

> For a good threat model we need to take these implementation details into account too

## Abstractions with Interfaces

* In computing an interface is a shared boundary across between two or more components of a to exchange information or expose functionality
* An interface usually defines data types, structures and operations, it hides implementation details, be it a local or a remote service interface. (nowadays, the term API is used to refer to both)
* Local (libraries, frameworks, i.e. JEE)
  * Implementation details, i.e. 
    * concurrency model, 
    * logging, 
    * file system operations,
    * dependencies
* Remote (SOAP/REST, WSDL /XSD/OpenAPI)
  * All the above + system architecture 
    (storage, compute, location, downstream services)
  * Questions of privacy and trust arise
