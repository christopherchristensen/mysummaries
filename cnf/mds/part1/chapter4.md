# Network Access



## Types of Connections

* Physical connection to local network needed for network communications
* Physical connection can be
  * wireless
  * wired



## Network Interface Cards

* NICs
* connect device to network
* used for **wired** connection
* Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) NICs for **wireless** connection



## Purpose of Physical Layer

* Provides the means to transport bits that make up a data link layer frame across the network media
* Accepts complete frame from data link layer and encodes it as a series of signals that are transmitted onto the local media
* Encoded bits that comprise a frame are received by
  * end device
  * intermediate device



## 3 Basic Forms of Network Media

* Electrical Signals (Copper cable)
* Light Pulse (Fiber-optic cable)
* Microwave Signals (Wireless)



## Physical Layer Standards

* International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
* Telecommunications Industry Association / Electronic Industries Association (TIA/EIA)
* International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
* American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
* Institute of Electrical und Electronics Engineers (IEEE)



## Physical Layer Functions

* Encoding
  * Converting stream of data bits into predefined "code"
* Signaling Method
  * Method of representation bits
  * Physical layer standards must define what type of signal represents a `1` and `0` 
  * Long pulse might represent `1` and short a `0`



## Modulation

* process where characteristics of one wave (signal) modifies another wave (carrier)
* $$\text{Modulation Wave} + \text{Carrier Signal} = \text{Signal}$$ (e.g. AM / FM)

## Bandwidth

* Capacity of a medium to carry data
* Digital Bandwidth measures amount of data
  * that can flow from one place to another
  * in a given amount of time
* Sometimes thought of speed that bits travel
  * that is not accurate
  * data always sent at same speed
  * 10Mb/s is the number of bits transmitted per second



## Throughput

* Measure of the transfer of bits across media over given period of time
* Usually doesn't match specified bandwidth
* Implementations due to
  * Amount of traffic
  * Type of traffic
  * Latency created by network devices 
    (between source / destination)
* e.g. Download Speed: 80.78 Mbps, Upload Speed: 8.78 Mbps



## Goodput

* Throughput minus traffic overhead for establishing
  * sessions
  * acknowledgements
  * encapsulation



## Types of Physical Media (Interfaces / Ports)

* FastEthernet Switch Ports
* SHDSL Interface
* Management Ports
* Gigabit Ethernet Interfaces
* USB Type A Connector



## Characteristics of Copper Media

* Transmitted on copper cables (electrical pulses)
* Attenuation
  * The longer signal travels, the more deterioration
* All copper media must follow strict distance limitations
* Electromagnetic interference (EMI) / Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)
  * Distorts and corrupts the data signals being carried by copper media
  * To counter copper cables wrapped in shielding
* Crosstalk
  * Disturbance caused by electric or magnetic fields of signal on one wire to the signal in an adjacent wire
  * To cancel crosstalk opposing circuit wire pairs twisted together



## 3 Types of Copper Media

* Unshielded Twisted-Pair (UTP) cable
* Shielded Twisted-Pair (STP) cable
* Coaxial cable



## Unshielded Twisted-Pair Cable

* most common networking media
* Terminated with RJ-45 connectors
* For interconnecting network hosts with networking devices (e.g. switches)
* Has 4 pairs of color-coded wires
  * wires twisted together
  * to protect against signal interference from other wires
* Color codes aid in cable termination



## How are UTP Cables built?

* Outer Jacket

* Color-Coded Plastic Insulation

  * Electrically isolates wires from each other
  * Identifies each pair

## Coaxial Cable

* Replace by UTP cables in modern Ethernet installations
* Used in
  * Wireless Installations (e.g. attach antennas to wireless devices)
  * Cable Internet Installations



## How are Coaxial Cables built?

* Copper conductor to transmit electronic signals

## Why are Safety Measure for Copper Media needed?

* Susceptible to fire and electrical hazards



## How to use Copper Media safely

* Separation of data and electrical power cabling must comply with safety codes
* Cables connected correctly
* Installations need damage inspection
* Correctly grounded equipment



## Properties of UTP Cabling

* 4 pairs of color-coded copper wires
  * twisted together
  * encased in flexible plastic sheath
* Small size advantageous during installation
* No shielding to counter effects of EMI / RFI
  * Cancellation: When 2 wires in electrical circuit placed close together, their magnetic fields are exact opposite of each other and cancel out any outside EMI and RFI signals
  * Varies the number of twists per wire pair to further enhance cancellation effects of a paired circuit
* Each colored pair twisted different number of times



## UTP Cabling Standards

* UTP conforms to standards established by TIA / EIA
* Cat 3 Cable
  * Voice communication
  * Most often phone lines
