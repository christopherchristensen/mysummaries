# MongoDB

## Notes from the talk
- you can add new fields dynamically at runtime
- can be hard to restructure existing schemas
- but you can change data types on the fly
- JSON only has a small amount of data types
- MongoDB uses Bison that has more data types
- MongoDB allow any data type per document, thus can cause issue, because devs might not know what data types they will be dealing with
- Therefor MongoDB allows for governing of the documents with JSON Schemas
- real-time event notification
- High availability replica sets: uses 2 secondary replications
- horizontal scaling through sharding
-
