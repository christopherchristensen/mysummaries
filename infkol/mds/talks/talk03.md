# Summary

Agile Software Development is known as an approach in developing software by putting the collaborative efforts of the collective team in the forefront. It was biggly popularized by the Manifesto for Agile Software Development (Wikipedia 2019) that was defined by a group of authors in the software development community (Beck 2001C). Those authors main values are as follows and quoted:

*   Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
*   Working software over comprehensive documentation
*   Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
*   Responding to change over following a plan

They claim that, *[â€¦] while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more* (Beck 2001A). The Agile Manifesto follows 12 principles that should lay the foundation for anyone who is interested in implementing the approach. The following list shows these 12 principles (Beck 2019B):

*   Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
*   Welcome changing requirements, even late in  development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
*   Deliver working software frequently, from a  couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
*   Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
*   Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
*   The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
*   Working software is the primary measure of progress.
*   Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
*   Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
*   Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
*   The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
*   At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. 

It is important to note that these are principles and do not tell you how these principles must be implemented to work. This leaves room for interpretation and for adaptation to the individual use cases.

# Questions

1.  For newcomer developers like me who have barely scraped the surface of the different types of approaches, it often seems like Agile Software Development is praised as the ultimate approach. In what use cases would you **not** recommend this approach?
2.  Are there any big functioning software companies that use entirely different approaches?
3.  Do you get customers that constantly reject results of iterations due to the unfinished status?
4.  Does Agile Development ever suffer under the "lazy" one?
5.  If working software is the primary measure of progress, isn't there an incentive to "fake" working software?
6.  Are there any difficulties in adapting this approach?
