# BioHackingEthics

## What is Hackteria?
- international network 
- active since 2009
- in the field of Open Source Biological Art

## Learning through reenactment
- use old procedures to reenact experiments 
    - to learn new things
    - improvements to the past due to new technology

## Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
- method widely used in molecular biology
- make many copies of a specific DNA segment
- copies of DNA sequences are exponentially amplified to generate thousands to millions of more copies of that particular DNA segment
- uses a lot of electronics and IT in the process

## OpenPCR
- Open-Source PCR
- All software is open source
- There are (priced) OpenPCR thermocyclers to control PCR reactions for 
    - DNA detection
    - beer spoilage
    - other applications

## DIY - VerhÃ¤ltnis: Kunst, Gesellschaft und Arbeit
- 1950er: Arts and Crafts Bewegung
- 1970er: Punkbewegung, DIY, Abkehr von "No Future"
- Heute:
    - Empowerment of individuals and communities
    - DIY 2.0 - Sharing over internet
    - Open Source Soft- und Hardware
    - Open access to knowledge and life science technology

## Merging Engineering and Life Science
- Information Technology
    - Global
    - Digital
    - Virtual
    - Bits
- Living Systems
    - Living
    - Complex
    - Material
    - Atoms

## Synthetic Biology
1. Using synthetic genes
2. to program cells to become factories
3. to make devices, sensors, pharmaceuticals, renewable chemicals, fuels and food

## BioFAB: From Bits to Cells
1. Gene pathway sequence
2. Corresponding array of overlapping oligonucleotides
3. Error correcting assembly in to low error rate pathways
4. Expression in cells

## BioBricks
> for genetically engineered machines (iGEM)

- BioBrick parts are DNA sequences
- used to design and assemble synthetic biological circuits
- then incorporated into living cells (such as Escherichia coli)
- to construct new biological systems
